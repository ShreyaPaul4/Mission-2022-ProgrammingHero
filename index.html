            <p class="design-paragraph">The explosive growth in technology currently underway requires top engineers to
                power it. Many companies
                have trouble hiring these professionals because they’re so in demand. However, the number of developers
                is increasing. According to the last available report from Evans Data Corporation, there are 26.9
                million software developers in 2021 — with 4.3 million of them in North America — a number that is
                expected to grow to 28.7 million in 2024.</p>

                <p class="design-paragraph">Last year we inaugurated our first-ever list of the best websites for
                    your
                    career. We took nominations from readers and combed through some 700 sites in order to compile
                    our
                    list of the top 75. This August we put out another call for nominations and got a flood of 2,000
                    comments, emails and tweets in response. Then we reviewed last year’s list and considered all of
                    the
                    new nominations. In the process we decided to expand our list to 100.

                    Our goal was to assemble a comprehensive guide to smart and engaging sites. We hope we’ve come
                    up
                    with a thorough list of online destinations for interns, job seekers, business owners,
                    established
                    professionals, retirees, and anyone else looking to launch, improve, advance, or change his or
                    her
                    career.
